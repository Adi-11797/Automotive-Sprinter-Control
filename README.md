# Sprinter-Control-Implementation-using-Webots
Linear Control Systems - Course Project

Programming implementations of 24-677: Linear Control Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2021.

This is a project in the course which looks at engineering the Control System of an simulated autonomous vehicle as it traverses CMU's historic Buggy track using Webots.

We will study this problem from various angles as we move through the rest of the course, applying newly learned control techniques on the autonomous vehicle system. We will follow the steps listed below to learn more about the system and synthesize several different kinds of controllers:
1. Examine the provided nonlinear control model
2. Linearize the state space system equations 
3. Develop a PID controller for the system 
4. Check the controllability and stabilizability of the system
5. Design a full-state feedback controller using pole placement 
6. Design an optimal controller
7. Implement an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
